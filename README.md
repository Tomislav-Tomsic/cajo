cajo
====

Mavenized clone of https://svn.java.net/svn/cajo~svn r2663

Cajo is a very simple way to have two JVM's communicate.

The official java.net project seems to have stagnated, so 
I have cloned the project as of r2663 to get the ball rolling 
with Mavenization while trying to get hold of John Catherino.

Unfortunately John Catherino died before I got hold of him :-(

As java.net is shutting down, here is an archived copy of the original
project pages.

I switched jobs where we are not actively using Cajo on a daily basis, 
but this is invaluable if you must invoke the program in a certain scenario
(like on a server providing a one-time token needed) but it is much easier
to run the program in your IDE on your own computer instead of 
deploying while still developing to a server.
